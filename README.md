# 🎓 Gyoshu & Jogyo

**English** | [中文](README.zh.md) | [한국어](README.ko.md) | [日本語](README.ja.md)

> *"Every great professor needs a great teaching assistant."*

**Gyoshu** (교수, *Professor*) orchestrates. **Jogyo** (조교, *Teaching Assistant*) executes.

Together, they form an end-to-end research automation system for [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode) that turns your research goals into reproducible Jupyter notebooks—complete with hypotheses, experiments, findings, and publication-ready reports.

## 🎭 The Cast

| Agent | Role | Korean | What They Do |
|-------|------|--------|--------------|
| **Gyoshu** | 🎩 Professor | 교수 | Plans research, orchestrates workflow, manages sessions |
| **Jogyo** | 📚 Teaching Assistant | 조교 | Executes Python code, runs experiments, generates outputs |
| **Baksa** | 🔍 PhD Reviewer | 박사 | Adversarial verifier — challenges claims, calculates trust scores |
| **Jogyo Paper Writer** | ✍️ Grad Student | 조교 | Transforms raw findings into narrative research reports |

Think of it like a research lab:

## 🤖 Installation for LLMs

> *Using Claude, GPT, Gemini, or another AI assistant with OpenCode? This section is for you.*

**Setup is the same** — install Gyoshu using the methods above, then give your LLM the context it needs:

1. **Point your LLM to the guide:**
   > "Read `AGENTS.md` in the Gyoshu directory for full context on how to use the research tools."

2. **Or paste this quick start prompt:**
   ```
   I've installed Gyoshu. Read AGENTS.md and help me run /gyoshu to analyze my data.
   ```

**Key commands your LLM should know:**
| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/gyoshu` | Start interactive research |
| `/gyoshu-auto <goal>` | Autonomous research (hands-off) |
| `/gyoshu doctor` | Check system health and diagnose issues |

> **Tip:** [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) contains everything an LLM needs — agents, commands, markers, troubleshooting, and more.

## 🔬 How Research Works

### 1. You Set a Goal
```
/gyoshu analyze wine quality factors and build a predictive model
```

### 2. The Professor Plans
Gyoshu creates a structured research plan with clear objectives and hypotheses.

### 3. The TA Executes
Jogyo runs Python code, using structured markers to organize output:

```python
print("[OBJECTIVE] Predict wine quality from physicochemical properties")
print("[HYPOTHESIS] Alcohol content is the strongest predictor")

# ... analysis code ...

print(f"[METRIC:accuracy] {accuracy:.3f}")
print("[FINDING] Alcohol shows r=0.47 correlation with quality")
print("[CONCLUSION] Hypothesis supported - alcohol is key predictor")
```

### 4. Auto-Generated Notebook
Everything is captured in `notebooks/wine-quality.ipynb` with full reproducibility.

### 5. AI-Written Report
The Paper Writer agent transforms markers into a narrative report:

> *"Our analysis of 1,599 wine samples revealed that alcohol content emerges as the dominant predictor of quality ratings (r = 0.47). The final Random Forest model achieved 87% accuracy..."*

**Runtime files** (sockets, locks) go to OS temp directories—not your project! 🧹

### What Gyoshu Creates

When you run research, Gyoshu creates these artifacts in your project:

```
your-project/
├── notebooks/
│   └── your-research.ipynb    ← Research notebook (source of truth)
├── reports/
│   └── your-research/
│       ├── figures/           ← Saved plots (.png, .svg)
│       ├── models/            ← Trained models (.pkl, .joblib)
│       └── report.md          ← Generated research report
└── (your existing files untouched!)
```

> **Note:** Gyoshu never modifies your `.venv/`, `data/`, or other existing project files.

## 🎯 Output Markers

The TA uses structured markers to organize research output:

### Core Markers

| Marker | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `[OBJECTIVE]` | Research goal | `[OBJECTIVE] Classify iris species` |
| `[HYPOTHESIS]` | What you're testing | `[HYPOTHESIS] H0: no difference; H1: petal length predicts species` |
| `[DATA]` | Dataset info | `[DATA] Loaded 150 samples` |
| `[FINDING]` | Key discovery | `[FINDING] Setosa is linearly separable (d=2.1, p<0.001)` |
| `[CONCLUSION]` | Final verdict | `[CONCLUSION] Hypothesis confirmed with large effect` |

### Statistical Evidence Markers (Required for Verified Findings)

| Marker | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `[STAT:ci]` | Confidence interval | `[STAT:ci] 95% CI [0.82, 0.94]` |
| `[STAT:effect_size]` | Effect magnitude | `[STAT:effect_size] Cohen's d = 0.75 (medium)` |
| `[STAT:p_value]` | Statistical significance | `[STAT:p_value] p = 0.003` |
| `[SO_WHAT]` | Practical significance | `[SO_WHAT] This means 15% cost reduction` |
| `[LIMITATION]` | Threats to validity | `[LIMITATION] Small sample size (n=50)` |

### ML Pipeline Markers

| Marker | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `[METRIC:baseline_*]` | Dummy model benchmark | `[METRIC:baseline_accuracy] 0.33` |
| `[METRIC:cv_*]` | Cross-validation scores | `[METRIC:cv_accuracy_mean] 0.95` |

> **Quality Gate**: Findings without `[STAT:ci]` and `[STAT:effect_size]` are marked as "Exploratory" in reports.

## 🐍 Python Environment

Gyoshu uses your project's `.venv/` virtual environment:

| Priority | Type | How It's Detected |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| 1️⃣ | Custom | `GYOSHU_PYTHON_PATH` env var |
| 2️⃣ | venv | `.venv/bin/python` exists |

**Quick setup:**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

> **Note:** Gyoshu uses your project's virtual environment. It never modifies system Python.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **OpenCode** v0.1.0+
- **Python** 3.10+

## 🎓 Why "Gyoshu" and "Jogyo"?

In Korean academia:

- **교수 (Gyoshu/Kyosu)** = Professor — the one who guides, plans, and oversees
- **조교 (Jogyo)** = Teaching Assistant — the one who executes, experiments, and does the heavy lifting

This reflects the architecture: Gyoshu is the orchestrator agent that plans and manages research flow, while Jogyo is the executor agent that actually runs Python code and produces results.

It's a partnership. The Professor has the vision. The TA makes it happen. Together, they publish papers. 📚

---

## 🤝 Optional Companion: Oh-My-OpenCode

> **Gyoshu works completely standalone.** It has its own agent stack and requires no other OpenCode extensions (like oh-my-opencode).

For **data-driven product development workflows**, you can optionally combine Gyoshu with [Oh-My-OpenCode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode):

| Tool | Focus | Independent? |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Gyoshu (this project)** | 📊 Research & Analysis | ✅ Fully standalone |
| **[Oh-My-OpenCode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode)** | 🏗️ Product Development | ✅ Fully standalone |

### Gyoshu's Own Agent Stack

Gyoshu includes everything it needs for research:

| Agent | Role | What They Do |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `@gyoshu` | Professor | Plans research, orchestrates workflow |
| `@jogyo` | TA | Executes Python code, runs experiments |
| `@baksa` | PhD Reviewer | Challenges claims, verifies evidence |
| `@jogyo-insight` | Evidence Gatherer | Searches docs, finds examples |
| `@jogyo-feedback` | Learning Explorer | Reviews past sessions for patterns |
| `@jogyo-paper-writer` | Report Writer | Transforms findings into narrative reports |

### Optional Workflow (When Combined)

If you choose to use both tools together:

1. **Research** with Gyoshu:
   ```
   /gyoshu-auto analyze user behavior and identify churn predictors
   ```
   → Produces insights: "Users who don't use feature X within 7 days have 3x churn rate"

2. **Build** with Oh-My-OpenCode:
   ```
   /planner implement onboarding flow that guides users to feature X
   ```
   → Ships the feature that addresses the insight

**Data informs decisions. Code ships solutions.** 🚀

> **Note:** You do NOT need Oh-My-OpenCode to use Gyoshu. Each tool works independently.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"No .venv found"** | Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install pandas numpy` |
| **"Bridge failed to start"** | Check Python version (need 3.10+): `python3 --version`. Check socket path permissions. |
| **"Session locked"** | Use `/gyoshu unlock <sessionId>` after verifying no process is running |
| **OpenCode not in PATH** | Install from [opencode-ai/opencode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode) |

Still stuck? Run `/gyoshu doctor` to diagnose issues.
