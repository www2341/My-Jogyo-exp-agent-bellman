Continue the current research session with:

$ARGUMENTS

The REPL environment is PRESERVED - all variables from previous executions are still available.

If the REPL was closed (e.g., restart), cells will be replayed to reconstruct state.

> **Note:** This can also resume ABORTED sessions (goalStatus: ABORTED). The session mode (PLANNER, AUTO, REPL) is preserved from when it was paused or aborted.
